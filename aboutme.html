          This is a toga I made by myself for the Opera, <em>La Belle Helene</em>. I first started with the bodice and then the skirt. Lastly I completed the look with a blue sash that could be snapped on and off of the costume piece. This costume in particular was for a ensemble member and in order to make sure that thier costume fits perfectly, the cast memebers go through multiple fittings. Luckly after three, I was able to complete my costume and the actress loved it.

          This is the steward costume I made for <em>Into the Woods</em>. This costume took me about 2 weeks to complete and included the process of many fittings, to make sure that the costume fit perfectly and fully embodied the designers rendering. What was so great about this project was that it was the first time I was able to make a costume for a male role, which was something new for me and allowed me to learn new important information on men's tailoring.
